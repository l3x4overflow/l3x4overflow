# 👋 Hi, I'm Axel

With over **6 years of experience in cybersecurity**, full-stack engineering, and now Web3 development, I specialize in building real-world, secure, and scalable systems, from offensive security tools to production grade platforms handling millions of events.

## 🛡️ Cybersecurity

I've reported multiple web vulnerabilities through responsible disclosure programs, including:

- 📌 `intranet.upv.es` – [XSS reported via OpenBugBounty](https://www.openbugbounty.org/reports/610439/)
- 📌 `uji.es` – [XSS vulnerability disclosed](https://www.openbugbounty.org/reports/610435/)
- 📌 `sede.madrid.es` – [XSS vulnerability disclosed](https://www.openbugbounty.org/reports/610443/)

From the offensive side:
- I developed a custom **Red Team tool** capable of generating advanced shellcodes and executing process injection via **direct syscalls**, fully bypassing mainstream antivirus solutions.  
- As part of that same research, I also discovered multiple critical vulnerabilities within the UPV ecosystem, specifically **XSS** and **SMTP misconfigurations**, that enabled the creation of highly convincing and sophisticated phishing and social engineering attacks.
- All findings and tools were thoroughly documented in my thesis:  
  📄 [Stealth malware & UPV vulnerability research – UPV repository](https://riunet.upv.es/entities/publication/186f4426-bdd3-4a97-b8b1-a8608422dc8d)

🧠 Languages: `C`, `C++`, `x86/x64 Assembly`, `Python`, `JavaScript`

## ⚙️ Full Stack & Scalable Systems (Wayob Labs)

As **CTO at Wayob Labs**, I designed and built a high-throughput analytics platform for crypto market behavior, used both internally and externally:

- Real-time ingestion of **millions of transactions** per day from exchanges like **Binance, Bybit, and Bitget**
- Advanced algorithm to **detect stop-loss accumulation** and identify market sentiment patterns
- Live data was streamed into a **microservice-based system**, using **Kafka** for inter-service communication.  
  Each microservice subscribed to **WebSocket feeds from exchanges** to collect trades in real time, apply predictive algorithms, open new trades, and continuously monitor their state.
- Secured backend infrastructure using **Azure Key Vault** for safe management of users' private API keys

🔧 Technologies used:
`React.js`, `Node.js`, `Express`, `Kubernetes`, `Kafka`, `Redis`, `Elasticsearch`, `MySQL`

### ➕ Real-world impact

Our system was later integrated by **[Storm](https://storm.tg)**, the largest decentralized exchange on the TON blockchain, embedding our **AI-powered trading assistant** directly into their DEX.

## 🔗 Web3 & Blockchain (BSVA)

Currently working with the **Bitcoin SV Blockchain Association (BSVA)**, focusing on:

- Creating **technical onboarding material** for Web3 developers
- Building **enterprise-grade data integrity solutions** for companies managing millions of on-chain transactions
