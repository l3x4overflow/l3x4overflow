# 👋 Hi, I'm Axel

With over **6 years of experience in cybersecurity**, full-stack engineering, and now Web3 development, I specialize in building real world, secure, and scalable systems, from offensive security tools to production grade platforms handling millions of events.

## 🛡️ Cybersecurity

I’ve discovered and responsibly disclosed **numerous vulnerabilities across major institutions in Spain**, including:

- 📌 `intranet.upv.es` – [XSS reported via OpenBugBounty](https://www.openbugbounty.org/reports/610439/)
- 📌 `uji.es` – [XSS vulnerability disclosed](https://www.openbugbounty.org/reports/610435/)
- 📌 `sede.madrid.es` – [XSS vulnerability disclosed](https://www.openbugbounty.org/reports/610443/)

From the offensive side:
- I developed a custom **Red Team tool** capable of generating advanced and custom shellcodes and executing process injection via **direct syscalls**, bypassing most mainstream antivirus engines and EDR. 📄 [Thesis repository link](https://github.com/l3x4overflow/tfg-repo)
- As part of that same research, I also uncovered critical **XSS and SMTP vulnerabilities** within the UPV ecosystem, enabling sophisticated phishing and impersonation attacks through abused mail servers.
- These findings and tools were all documented in my thesis:  
  📄 [Stealth malware & UPV vulnerability research – UPV repository](https://riunet.upv.es/entities/publication/186f4426-bdd3-4a97-b8b1-a8608422dc8d)

🧠 Languages: `C`, `C++`, `x86/x64 Assembly`, `Python`, `JavaScript`

## ⚙️ Full Stack & Scalable Systems (Wayob Labs)

As **CTO at Wayob Labs**, I led the development of a high-performance analytics and automation platform for crypto market behavior:

- Real time ingestion of **millions of trades per day** from exchanges like **Binance, Bybit, and Bitget**
- Predictive algorithm to detect **stop-loss accumulations** and assess market sentiment
- Built on a **microservices architecture**, with **Kafka** and **Redis Pub/Sub** for internal communication and caching,  **Kubernetes and Docker** for microservices and resources management, and **WebSocket integration with exchanges** to capture trades in real time, trigger algorithms, and manage open trade positions
- Secured backend using **Azure Key Vault** for safe management of users’ private keys

We also developed a **fully functional SaaS** subscription platform offering:
- Access to real time analytics and predictive metrics
- Automated trading bots powered by the platform’s algorithm
- Auth, payments, dashboards, and a customer portal.

In addition, **Wayob Labs obtained the European pre MiCA license** for digital asset custody and exchange operations, officially authorized to:
- Safely store user funds and private keys
- Operate as a licensed exchange for cryptocurrencies and digital assets  
✅ This license was approved and recognized by the **European Central Bank**.

🔧 Technologies used:
`React.js`, `Node.js`, `Express`, `Kubernetes`, `Kafka`, `Redis`, `Elasticsearch`, `MySQL`

### ➕ Real-world impact

Our technology was later integrated by **[Storm](https://storm.tg)**, the largest decentralized exchange on the TON blockchain, embedding our **AI-powered trading assistant** directly into their platform.
